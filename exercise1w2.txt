1. Newton Second Law

    Algoritma:
        1. Assign 'm' equals to 600.
        2. Assign 'a' equals to 2.
        3. Assign 'force' equals to any value.
        4. Calculate 'm' times 'a'.
        5. Set calculation result to 'force'
        5. Display force.

    Pseudocode:
        STORE 'm' with 600
        STORE 'a' with 2
        STORE 'force' with any value
        CALCULATE 'm' times 'a'
        SET 'force' value with calculation result
        DISPLAY force

2. Tahun Kabisat
    Algoritma:
        1. Assign 'year' with any value.
        2. If 'year' mod 4 equals to zero and 'year' mod 100 not equal to zero then 'year' is a leap year.
        3. If 'year' mod 4 equals to zero and 'year' mod 100 equals to zero and 'year' mod 400 equals to zero then 'year' is a leap year.
        4. If none of the conditions above is fulfilled then 'year' is not a leap year.

    Pseudocode:
        STORE year with any value
        IF 'year' mod 4 equals to 0 and 'year' mod 100 not equal to 0
        then DISPLAY "is a Leap Year."
        IF 'year' mod 4 equals to 0 and 'year' mod 100 equals to 0 and 'year' mod 400 equals to 0
        then DISPLAY " is a Leap Year."
        ELSE DISPLAY " is not a Leap Year."

3. Laundry Day
    Algoritma:
        1. Put clothes in the washing machine one by one.
        2. Count the clothes.
        3. While clothes in the washing machine is not 20 pieces,
            keep adding clothes to the washing machine.
        4. Start the washing machine when there are 20 pieces of clothes inside the washing machine.

    Pseudocode:
        STORE 'clothes' with any value
        WHILE 'clothes' is less than 20
            ADD 'clothes' by 1
        END WHILE
        DISPLAY 'Start the washing machine'

4. Periksa Kuku
    Algoritma:
        1. Count the number of the students.
        2. Check each of the students' nails.
        3. If their nails are short, praise them.
        4. If their nails are long, punish them.

    Pseudocode:
    STORE 'students' equals to 40
    STORE 'nailsLength' equals to 'long' or 'short'
    WHILE  'students' is less than 40
        ADD 'students' by 1
        IF 'nailsLength' equals to 'short'
            DISPLAY 'praise'
        IF 'nailsLength' equals to 'long'
            DISPLAY 'punish'
        END IF
    END WHILE
